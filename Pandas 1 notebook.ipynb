    "\n",
    "1. What is pandas and why do we use pandas?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Basic data structures of pandas -- **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Series and DataFrame.</code>**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">pd.read_csv() function</code>** to load or import the csv dataset into pandas.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Inspecting the DataFrame:</code>**\n",
    "    * The **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">head() method</code>** used to access first few rows of a DataFrame or Series.\n",
    "    * Just writing the name of dataframe and executing it will give us the entire dataset as output on screen.\n",
    "    * **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">type() function</code> is a python function used to know the type of object, whether its a dataframe or series.**\n",
    "    * The **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">tail() method</code>** is used to access last few rows of a DataFrame or Series.\n",
    "    * If we want to find the dimensions or shape of the dataframe, we can use the **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">shape attribute.</code>**\n",
    "    * **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">info() method</code>** tells us how many rows and columns are there in our dataframe, for each column how many null and not null values are there, datatype of all those values and the memory usage of the dataframe.\n",
    "    * The **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">columns attribute</code>** is used to access and view the column labels (column names) of a DataFrame. Indexing can be used on top of it to fetch the exact column name.\n",
    "    * If we want to access a particular column in a pandas DataFrame, we can do it by using square brackets [ ] and writing code as **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">df[\"col_name\"].</code>** Similarly, if we want to access multiple columns, we will provide a list of column names inside **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">df[\"col_1\", col_2\"].</code>**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Creating a DataFrame from scratch: pd.DataFrame()</code>** is a function used to create a dataset from scratch. There are two approaches called row oriented and column oriented approach to create a new dataframe from scratch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Basic operations on a column:</code>**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">unique() method</code>** we will get all the unique values in a column. Kind of like \"distinct\" in sql.\n",
    "    * **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">nunique() method</code>** gives us a count or total number of unique values in a column.\n",
    "    * **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">value_counts() method</code>** is very very frequently used method. It returns for every unique value, how many times its occuring in that column.\n",
    "    * Renaming a column- **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">rename() method</code>** is used to rename column names. To rename a column, we pass a dictionary in the rename() method, where, dict key is the existing column name and dict value is the new name that we want to update. Now in one way it does not modify the original dataframe, it just creates a copy of it and returns us that. In another way, by passing an argument inplace = True, we can modify the original dataframe itself. \n",
    "    * Deleting a column- There is a method called **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">drop() method</code>** which deletes columns. One syntax is df.drop(\"col_name\", axis = 1). Here inplace argument can be supplied as per requirement. Another syntax is new_df.drop(columns = [\"col_1\", \"col_2\", \"col_3\"]). Here axis argument is not required and multiple columns can be deleted in one go. Again inplace argument can be supplied as per requirement.\n",
    "    * **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Creating a column-</code>** We can create a new column from existing columns by performing some arithmetic operation or we can create a new column from scratch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Dataframe indexing-</code>** There are two types of indexes called <code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">implicit and expicit index.</code> There are various indexing options and ways available to index columns and rows including loc and iloc indexers. In other words with these ways we can acccess rows and columns of our dataset.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Setting the index to some other value by using **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">df.set_index(\"index_name\") method.</code>**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Resetting the index back to original can be done using **<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">df.reset_index() method.</code>**  \n",

    "\n",
    "**<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library</code> for the Python programming language. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured data, such as tabular data, time series, and more. Pandas is a popular choice among data scientists, analysts, and engineers for a variety of data-related tasks.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### <code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Why do we use pandas?</code> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **<u>Data Import and Export:</u>** Pandas makes it easy to import data from various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, and more. You can also export data to these formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **<u>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</u>** Pandas offers a wide range of functions for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing. This includes handling missing data, removing duplicates, converting data types, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **<u>Data Exploration and Analysis:</u>** You can perform various data analysis tasks with Pandas, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregating, and computing descriptive statistics. It allows you to gain insights into your data quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **<u>Time Series Analysis:</u>** Pandas has built-in support for time series data, making it well-suited for working with temporal data and conducting time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **<u>Data Visualization:</u>** While Pandas itself is not a data visualization library, it can be easily integrated with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **<u>Integration with Other Libraries:</u>** Pandas can seamlessly integrate with other Python libraries commonly used in data science, such as NumPy for numerical operations and scikit-learn for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **<u>Performance and Efficiency:</u>** Pandas is designed for high performance and memory efficiency, making it suitable for working with large datasets.\n",

    "### <code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Series and Dataframe:</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<code style=\"background:yellow;color:black\">Pandas introduces two primary data structures, namely, Series and DataFrame.</code>**\n",
    "\n",
    "* <u>**Series:**</u> A one-dimensional array-like object that can hold data of any data type. It's similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single feature in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <u>**DataFrame:**</u> A two-dimensional tabular data structure that resembles a table with rows and columns. It's used to store and manipulate structured data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we are working with a data which is of different formats, like for example in excel, we have some integer datatype columns some string datatype column and some can be float, so whenever we are working with data where different columns have different datatypes, **that dataset WE CALL IT PANDAS DATAFRAME**. A Dataframe is nothing but a table in form of rows and columns just like sql tables or excel spreadsheets. "

    "    * We have to provide the list of all the values that will be present in the new column. As its practically impossible to write 1704 values, so we will write a loop. \n",
